When using the diff the text is highlighted
and very easy to spot differences.
With lots of text this would be tedious
to nearly impossible.

Having different versions of a file would
allow you to compare code at various stages.
This could let you go back to previous
versions if changes did not work correctly.

You might forget to commit code and lose work
if you run into an issue with the computer.
You might commit too much at once.

Git allows multiple files in one commit since
they are related. Google docs does not treat
the fies as related so it saves them one at a time.

Git log will show all of the commited versions.
Git diff will allow comparison of these versions.

With version control you can be confident that the
ability to revert back to a previous version would
be available.

 I would like to use Git for my project code moving
 forward.
