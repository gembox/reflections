When you initialize a repository
you create the repository. This must
create the needed references for git.

The staging area are the items that have
not been added to the commit. The working
directory and repository already have the known
contents. This allows the flexibility of what to
inlcude and when.

Using the staging area can ensure that you are
making a single change before you commit those
changes. It gives you a chance to review the
work prior to committing it to the code.

Diagrams help with branches by drawing clear
paths of what branches exist, and what commits
are in each branch.
