Using a remote reposity will prevent
loss of work if you have issues with a local
machine. It will also allow collaboration with
other users.

When pulling changes manually you will be aware
of what changes are being allowed into the repository.
If they were automatic you could receive unwanted code.

A fork is a copy of another repository from someone on
GitHub to your GitHub. A clone is a copy of a repository from
GitHub to your machine, or locally on the machine. A branch
is a different path in a repository from the exisitng path.

The benefit of having the most recent state of the remote
would ensure that you are working off of the latest changes
and don't have missing information when you go to commit.
